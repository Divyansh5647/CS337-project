## Overview

We demonstrated that using Disagreement Learning can improve the diversity of the various models trained and hence encourages better generalization for the ensemble. This also ensures that the model does not make costly mistakes when it is unsure and decreases the confidence on predicting images it isn't supposed to predict.

## Our Hypothesis

1. Hypothesis 1
We want to demonstrate
2. Hypothesis 2


## How to run code
