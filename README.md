## Goal (Nov 6 2023) - 


We intend to use a student-teacher setup to distill a large teacher network into a small student network.

We want to experiment with the effect of disagreement learning on this and see if the resulting ensemble can help improve the results

We will try to use ensemble learning techniques along with knowledge distillation to see if there are any possible improvements
